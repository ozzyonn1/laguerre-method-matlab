# Laguerre's Method - Polynomial Root Finding

Detecting polynomial roots numerically using Laguerre's iterative method.  
This project was created for the Numerical Methods course.

---

## 📝 Project Description
The goal of this project is to implement Laguerre's method for finding approximate roots of a given polynomial using MATLAB.  
The project includes a core function for performing iterations as well as test scripts for different types of polynomials.

Important:  
The documentation (Metoda_Laguerre.pdf) and code comments are written in Polish, as this project was developed during a university course in Poland.

## 📊 Example Usage
The method is tested on polynomials of degree 2, 3, 4, and 8.  
Results obtained using Laguerre’s method are compared with MATLAB’s built-in `roots` function.  
Plots are generated to visualize polynomial curves and their roots on the complex plane.
